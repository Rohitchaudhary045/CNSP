To prepare for the CNSP exam, I used the following resources:

    Textbooks: "CompTIA Network+ Study Guide" by Todd Lammle and "Network Security Essentials" by William Stallings.
    Online Courses: Courses from Coursera and Udemy on network security topics.
    Video Tutorials: Professor Messerâ€™s YouTube channel for detailed explanations.
    Practice Labs: Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3 for hands-on practice.
    Practice Exams: Boson practice exams to simulate the test environment.
